# OAuth2 Implementation Project

This project is an OAuth2 server implementation built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/). It provides secure authentication and authorization services, supporting OAuth2 flows, JWT-based tokens, and integration with a database via Prisma ORM.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to offer a robust, extensible, and secure OAuth2 server that can be integrated into modern applications for user authentication and API authorization. It is suitable for both internal and public-facing systems.

## High-Level Workflow
- Clients and users interact with OAuth2 endpoints to obtain access and refresh tokens.
- Tokens are signed and verified using RSA keypairs loaded at startup.
- User and client data are managed in a relational database via Prisma.
- The system is modular, allowing for easy extension and customization.
